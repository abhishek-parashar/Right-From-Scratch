### Notes

- for loop in range function it starts from 0 but goes to n-1
- for loop in list it starts from the first element in the list 
- index() can be used to find the position in the list.
- Try binary search algorithm if searching questions doesn't go well or question in which if we can divide it in halves and we can solve by shortenning them
- sieve function to calculate the prime no or generate the prime no.
- for searching if sorted array is mentioned always use binary search.
- binary search we have to decide where we have to go either left or right - for question such as finding the first and last index we just have to icorporate a normal binary search without much of modifications
- for infinite sorted array we have to take the start as 0 index and end as 1 update end by multiplying by 2. update start= end
- for backtracking we have to follow simple proceedure first append the values, call the recursive function with i+1 and then pop the element. this all inside a for loop.
