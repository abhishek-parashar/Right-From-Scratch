# Right-From-Scratch 

### GFG, LEETCODE, INTERVIEWBIT, HACKERANK, HACKEREARTH, KAGGLE

- This repository is implementation of data structures, different digital signal processing algorithms and methods, competitive coding questions, equations, algorithms, mathematics formulas and methods, neural network, different machine learning algorithms etc all from scratch in hard coded python, Julia.
- The repository also contains code for different machine learning, data science, deep learning hackathons, online competitions I have participated.   
- I will be creating this repository as notes for my future endevours.

 #### I did some competitve practice against all odds in Python - Here are some questions I practiced, question numbered at random.
##### 1. Searching:- Binary searching etc
- Count the zeros - Amazon, Yahoo
- Kth smallest element - Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft, Hike, Snapdeal etc.
- Maximum Value in a bitonic Array - Amazon
- Find Transition Point - Amazon
- Good Pairs
- Element Appearing Once - Amazon, Qualcomm
- Index of an extra element - Amazon, Zoho
- Maximum no of 1's in a row - Deshaw, Paytm
- Peak Element - Adobe, Amazon, Google, Visa
- Counting elements in two arrays - Amazon
- Array subset of another array - Qualcomm
- Smallest positive missing no - Amazon, Samsung, Snapdeal
- Magnet Array problem- De Shaw

- Leaders in an array- Amazon
- Floor in a sorted array - Amazon, Microsoft
- Happiest triplet 
- Facing the sun - Amazon
- Smallest Factorial no 
- Missing elements in ap
- Sonam bewafas asks questions.
- minimum element in a rotated array
