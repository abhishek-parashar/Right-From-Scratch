### Notes

- for loop in range function it starts from 0 but goes to n-1
- for loop in list it starts from the first element in the list 
- index() can be used to find the position in the list.
- Try binary search algorithm if searching questions doesn't go well or question in which if we can divide it in halves and we can solve by shortenning them
- sieve function to calculate the prime no or generate the prime no.
